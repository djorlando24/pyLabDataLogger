INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

pyLabDataLogger depends on the following python packages:
- pyUSB
- numpy 
- pyAPT for Linux, see hhttps://gitlab.com/weinshec/pyAPT.git
  or use the python2 modified version in thirdParty directory
- For I2C devices, you will need smbus module 
  and driver specific modules i.e. Adafruit_ADS1x15
- for Picoscope devices, install pico-python
  https://github.com/colinoflynn/pico-python
- For Pico USB TC-08, the usbtc08 python module is required. See thirdParty/usbtc08
- For Agilent 33220A, usbtmc driver is required:
  https://github.com/python-ivi/python-usbtmc

pyLabDataLogger also requires the following external software:
- python2 and python3 development headers
- Any generic USB serial port drivers that your system does not have. By default Linux has most standard serial to USB device drivers in the kernel. MacOS and Windows may require FTDI, CP2102, etc. driver packages. These should come with the hardware and are also available online.
- sigrok dependencies: 
    libftdi, libusb, doxygen, swig, glibmm, python-gobject, python-gi-dev
- sigrok, see https://sigrok.org/wiki/Downloads
  You will need to build from source code to get support for the latest devices.
  I found the versions shipped with Ubuntu didn't support all my hardware.
- sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw for USBee ADCs, with udev rules installed to avoid
  need for root (see https://sigrok.org/wiki/Fx2lafw)
- For Pico devices, the open source Pico libraries need to be installed.
  see https://www.picotech.com
- For Measurement Computing devices, mcclibusb
  see https://github.com/chrismerck/mcc-libusb.git

System configuration
- You need to be able to write and read hardware serial ports. On linux, run:
    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
