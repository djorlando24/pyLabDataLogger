INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

pyLabDataLogger depends on the following python packages:
- pyUSB
- numpy 

pyLabDataLogger also requires the following external software:
- sigrok dependencies: libftdi, libusb, doxygen, swig, glibmm, python-gobject, python-gi-dev
- sigrok, see https://sigrok.org/wiki/Downloads
  You will need to build from source code to get support for the latest devices.
  I found the versions shipped with Ubuntu didn't support all my hardware.
- sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw for USBee ADCs, with udev rules installed to avoid need for root
  (see https://sigrok.org/wiki/Fx2lafw)
- python2 and python3 development headers
