INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

pyLabDataLogger depends on the following python packages:
- pyUSB
- numpy 

pyLabDataLogger also requires the following external software:
- sigrok, see https://sigrok.org/wiki/Downloads
  You will need to build from source code to get support for the latest devices.
  I found the versions shipped with Ubuntu didn't support all my hardware.
- libusb, which pyUSB needs (but it may not tell you during its installation).
  On macOS you can use homebrew to get it, on Linux install python-libusb1 or libusb-dev
