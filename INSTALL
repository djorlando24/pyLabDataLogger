INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

pyLabDataLogger depends on the following python packages:
- pyUSB
- numpy 
- pyAPT for Linux, see hhttps://gitlab.com/weinshec/pyAPT.git
  or use the python2 modified version in thirdParty directory
- For I2C devices, you will need smbus module 
  and driver specific modules i.e. Adafruit_ADS1x15

pyLabDataLogger also requires the following external software:
- python2 and python3 development headers
- sigrok dependencies: 
    libftdi, libusb, doxygen, swig, glibmm, python-gobject, python-gi-dev
- sigrok, see https://sigrok.org/wiki/Downloads
  You will need to build from source code to get support for the latest devices.
  I found the versions shipped with Ubuntu didn't support all my hardware.
- sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw for USBee ADCs, with udev rules installed to avoid
  need for root (see https://sigrok.org/wiki/Fx2lafw)
- For Pico devices, the open source Pico libraries need to be installed.
  see https://www.picotech.com
- For Pico USB TC-08, the usbtc08 python module is required. See thirdParty/usbtc08
- For Measurement Computing devices, mcclibusb
  see https://github.com/chrismerck/mcc-libusb.git

System configuration
- You need to be able to write and read hardware serial ports. On linux, run:
    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
