# multicomp_mp730679
Access digtal multimeter Multicomp Pro 730679 (a rebadged UNI-T UT61E+) from Python via CP2110 based USB connection
Forked from https://github.com/ljakob/unit_ut61eplus

It should work also for other models: 

* UT60BT
* UT61B+
* UT61D+
* UT161B
* UT161D
* UT161E

but for this the unit conversion has to be adjusted (see `from_vendor/*.json`)
