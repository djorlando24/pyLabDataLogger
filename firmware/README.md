This directory contains firmware for devices such as Arduino micocontrollers, that pyLabDataLooger is compatible with.
The firmware generally consists of a program that reads a physical value from hardware, and writes the result to a serial
port or similar communications method for pyLabDataLogger to read.

Confirmed working devices include the Arduino Uno, Teensy, Arduino Leonardo, the DFRobot Beetle, and the uDuino.
