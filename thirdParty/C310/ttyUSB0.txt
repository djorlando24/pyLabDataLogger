# This covers what happened while interceptty was watching /dev/USB0 while Windows PC talked to the device.

First I turned on the meter
Then I opened the software
The reading was abou 46% and 25C
After a while I blew on it to make the humidity change for a moment -went up to 65%
Then I turned off the meter
Then I restarted the software
Then I started the meter
Then I started the timer
Then I stopped the timer at 62s 
Then I switched from C to F for a while
Then switched to MAX mode
Then to MIN mode
Then MAX MIN
Then back to normal
Then HOLD
Then reset the timer
Then turned off meter
